custom error page
Adding sponsor links and images (with hover state)

Last: cross-browser testing

Lisa's feedback:
too red, maybe a different highlight colour? Orange?
use "re-launch" phrasing in copy
tshirt linkage
suggests single line only for archive
show countdown of attendee spots left available
use active states on tabs
create active state for master nav
default mugshot looks like an alien...
add see your profile link to edit page
improve profile form submission flash
promote sponsorship opportunities more
change jammer/new peep to login/register
why do I have to create a Webjam account to attend? needs explanation
change "good-looking" copy
show current count more prominently on events, home and when logged out
add info about what owning an account entails - contact from WJ, benefits etc
why doesn't it remember URL for login?
Send unlogged in users to custom login/registration page with explanation about why they need to have an account to attend etc


BUGS:

"Unsure whether you need to say 'do you want to register instead?' 2 lines beneath 'dont have a webjam account? register one!'. It's left there"

weird line breaks in news archive, fix punctuation (stupid HAML newlines - needs helper?)
form error messages suck
make reversed hover states for sponsors
lame column sizing on Edit profile page
validate microformats

FF2 on XP:
registration alignment
scrollbar at foot of blog post
rogue border at bottom blog post


TODO later:

make mugshot form layout look good
tie RSVPs to Proposals? how?
Build hotted up active version for events!
Integrate Upcoming? http://flickr.com/photos/tags/upcoming%3Aevent%3D262836/
