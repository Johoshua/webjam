What happened to exception notifications?
confirm identity with Yahoo! etc (http://blog.nerdbank.net/2008/06/why-yahoo-says-your-openid-site.html)

Lisa's feedback:    (whenever this list gets to zero - ask Lisa for another expert review!)
suggests single line only for archive - ?? check on this now we've fixed newline bug
default mugshot looks like an alien...
promote sponsorship opportunities more
add info about what owning an account entails - contact from WJ, benefits etc
why doesn't it remember URL for login?
Send unlogged in users to custom login/registration page with explanation about why they need to have an account to attend etc
the display of comments , author, comment number are upside down and could be made more readable
Latest news looks silly against currently latest news article

BUGS:

form error messages suck
validate microformats

FF2 on XP:
registration alignment
scrollbar at foot of blog post
rogue border at bottom blog post

IE6:
Top tabs look weird
Login is apparently not too cool


TODO later:

make mugshot form layout look good
lame column sizing on Edit profile page
tie RSVPs to Proposals? how?
Integrate Upcoming? http://flickr.com/photos/tags/upcoming%3Aevent%3D262836/

Confirm our website identity with Yahoo! ?? (for better registration)
Merge registration and login into one process.
Add parsing for @username string to all user content (http://lachstock.com.au/inc/js/status.js has good regex)
Comments feed
Build hotted up active version for events!


DYLAN'S TOTO:
I haven't looked above. I should. Here are some things I've been thinking about:
•	layout of upcoming events thing
•	funkiness with front page top event in windows FF2 around the rego things
•	news archives weird borders left cols
•	admin is ugly
•	microformats:
	⁃	hcard
	⁃	hcalendar
	⁃	hatom
•	RDF
•	profile page = gross and should not be (see webjam.ai file for what it should be)
•	valid markup? (oops. My bad - LH.)
•	valid css? (we has it!)
•	Browser testing -- Chrome, IE6, IE7, IE8, FF2, FF3, Opera, Iphone and Saruman's Wizard Crystal Globe
•	sitemap
•	custom 404 page
