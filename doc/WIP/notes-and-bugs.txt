DYLAN'S TOTO:
I haven't looked above. I should. Here are some things I've been thinking about:
•	layout of upcoming events thing
•	funkiness with front page top event in windows FF2 around the rego things
•	news archives weird borders left cols
•	admin is ugly
•	microformats:
	⁃	hcard
	⁃	hcalendar
	⁃	hatom
•	RDF
•	profile page = gross and should not be
•	valid markup?
•	valid css?
•	Browser testing -- Chrome, IE6, IE7, IE8, FF2, FF3, Opera, Iphone and Saruman's Wizard Crystal Globe
•	sitemap
•	custom 404 page
